        How does Tentez OU use uploaded images?
      </h2>
      <ul class="privacy-policy-text-paragraph-list">
        <li>Your images are secure and will be treated confidentially.</li>
        <li>
          Tentez OU transfers them SSL/TLS-encrypted and use them only to remove
          the background and then offer you the result for download.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tentez OU does not share them with third parties, do not publish them
          and do nothing else with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the latest about one hour after the upload Tentez OU deletes both
          the uploaded image and the result image.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Apart from that, Tentez OU keeps usage statistics (without images) and
        if you contact us e.g. by email, Tentez OU also receives personal data
        from you, which Tentez OU uses to reply to you. If Tentez OU has a
        customer/supplier relationship, Tentez OU also uses your data for
        bookkeeping and similar purposes.

        If this privacy policy is presented by the data controller in a language
        other than German, the translation was prepared by an independent
        specialist translator certified to ISO 17100:2015 and proofread by at
        least one other specialist translator. If, in the case of dispute, a
        court insists on a German-language contract text, then only the original
        German-language contract text shall be valid; under no circumstances
        shall a retranslation of the translated version be used.
